  Search, compare, evaluate, and hand off hotel bookings using the MoodTrip.ai
  MCP server (api.moodtrip.ai). Requires MoodTrip to be connected as an MCP
  integration (Settings > Integrations > Add Custom Integration > URL
  https://api.moodtrip.ai/api/mcp-http). Use this skill whenever the user
  mentions hotels, accommodation, lodging, stays, travel bookings, hotel search,
  hotel comparison, hotel reviews, hotel pricing, or anything related to finding
  or booking a place to stay. Also trigger when the user asks about hotel
  amenities, room types, check-in/check-out logistics, travel destinations with
  accommodation needs, or says things like find me a hotel, where should I stay,
  book a room, hotel recommendations, or compare hotels. This skill connects to
  the MoodTrip MCP server which provides real-time hotel inventory, pricing,
  semantic search, reviews, and booking link handoff via LiteAPI.

# MoodTrip Hotel Search Skill

> ⚠️ **Prerequisites — MCP Connection Required**
>
> This skill provides **instructions only** — it tells the agent how to use MoodTrip's tools,
> but it does **not** create a network connection to the MoodTrip server.
> You must connect MoodTrip as an MCP integration on your platform for the skill to work.
>
> **Quick setup by platform:**
> | Platform | How to connect |
> |----------|---------------|
> | **Claude.ai** | Settings → Integrations → **+ Add Custom Integration** → Name: `MoodTrip`, URL: `https://api.moodtrip.ai/api/mcp-http` |
> | **Claude Desktop** | Settings → Extensions → Add, or edit `claude_desktop_config.json` (see below) |
> | **ChatGPT** | Settings → Integrations → MCP → Add URL: `https://api.moodtrip.ai/api/mcp-http` |
> | **OpenClaw / other agents** | Add MCP server config with URL: `https://api.moodtrip.ai/api/mcp-http` |
>
> Without this connection, hotel search tools will not be available and calls will fail.

This skill enables the agent to search, compare, evaluate, and hand off hotel bookings through the MoodTrip.ai MCP server. The server exposes 12 core tools covering the full hotel discovery-to-booking-handoff workflow.

Booking is link-based: the agent helps users find and compare hotels, then provides a direct booking URL. The user completes the reservation on the MoodTrip website.

## Decision Rules

Before calling any tool, apply these rules to pick the right one:

| Condition | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| User has dates + destination + wants prices | `searchHotelsWithRates` |
| User describes a vibe, mood, or style | `searchHotelsSemanticQuery` |
| User asks about one specific hotel | `getHotelDetails` or `askHotelQuestion` |
| No pricing needed yet / just browsing | `findHotels` |
| Quick single-room adult-only search | `quickHotelSearch` |
| User wants reviews or guest opinions | `getHotelReviews` |
| User wants to find a specific room type or match a photo | `searchRooms` |
| Previous search returned no results | `relaxConstraints` |
| User asks "when is cheapest to visit X?" | `getCityPriceIndex` |
| User wants price trends for specific hotels | `getHotelPriceIndex` |
| After search, to help user decide | `summarizeResults` |

## Available Tools (12 core tools)

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `searchHotelsSemanticQuery` | AI-powered natural language hotel search | Vibe/style searches ("romantic getaway", "boutique with rooftop") |
| `searchHotelsWithRates` | Search with real-time pricing | When user has specific dates and needs prices |
| `quickHotelSearch` | Simplified search with live pricing | Quick single-room adult-only searches |
| `findHotels` | Metadata search (no pricing) | Browsing/exploring without specific dates |
| `getHotelDetails` | Full hotel info + optional pricing | Deep-dive into a specific hotel |
| `getHotelReviews` | Guest reviews + optional sentiment | User wants to hear what others say |
| `askHotelQuestion` | AI Q&A about a specific hotel | "Does this hotel have parking?" type questions |
| `searchRooms` | Visual/text room search | Find specific room types or match a photo |
| `summarizeResults` | AI summary of search results | After a search, to help user decide |
| `getHotelPriceIndex` | Historical price trends per hotel | Price comparison over time |
| `getCityPriceIndex` | City-level price trends | "When is Paris cheapest?" |
| `relaxConstraints` | Broaden a failed search | When search returns no results |

### Agent Builder Tools (optional)

If the platform exposes OpenAI Agent Builder tools in addition to the core MCP tools, the following may also be available:

| Tool | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `build_booking_link` | Generate booking/gallery URLs from a hotelId | `hotelId` (required), `checkin`, `checkout`, `adults`, `children` (array of ages 0–17, max 6), `currency` |
| `search` | Extended search wrapper | All `searchHotelsWithRates` params plus: `starRating` (array, e.g., `[4, 4.5, 5]`), `boardType` (`RO`, `BB`), `refundableRatesOnly` (boolean), `hotelIds` (search specific hotels), `location` (alias for city). Also accepts multiple query aliases (`text`, `input`, `message`, `prompt`, `content`, `body`) for cross-platform compatibility. |
| `fetch` | Hotel details wrapper | `hotelId`, `checkin`, `checkout`, `adults`, `currency` only. Note: neither `language` nor `guestNationality` are supported on Agent Builder `fetch` — use the standard MCP `getHotelDetails` if you need localized descriptions or nationality-based pricing. |

These are not part of the standard MCP `tools/list` and may not be present in all clients. Always check tool availability first.

## Conversation State Management

Maintain context across turns throughout the conversation:

- **Reuse hotel IDs** from previous results when the user references a hotel by name or position ("the second one", "Hotel X")
- **Carry forward destination, dates, occupancy, and currency** — don't re-ask for details the user already provided
- **Preserve user preferences** (budget, must-haves, style) across follow-up queries
- **Track which hotels were already shown** to avoid repeating results
- When the user says "compare them" or "tell me more about the first one", resolve references from the most recent search results

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Destination Discovery (no dates yet)

The user knows where they want to go but hasn't committed to dates.

1. Use `findHotels` with city (and optionally country, minRating, maxPrice) to get hotel metadata
2. Present results with name, rating/10, location, and photos
3. If user wants more detail on a specific hotel → `getHotelDetails`
4. If user wants reviews → `getHotelReviews`
5. Once dates are known → switch to `searchHotelsWithRates` for live pricing

### Workflow 2: Full Search with Pricing

The user has dates, destination, and wants to see prices.

1. Use `searchHotelsWithRates` with checkin, checkout, occupancies, and cityName+countryCode (or placeId)
2. **Default limit is 3 hotels.** Set `limit` to 5–10 for broader results.
3. Present results using the display format below
4. If user wants to narrow down → use filters (maxPrice, hotelName) or follow up with `getHotelDetails`
5. If user wants to compare → present a comparison table
6. Provide booking links from the response — results typically include `bookingUrl` and `galleryUrl` when dates are provided

### Workflow 3: Vibe/Semantic Search

The user describes a mood or style rather than specific criteria.

1. Use `searchHotelsSemanticQuery` with the natural language query
2. ALWAYS include city and/or countryCode when a destination is mentioned — without location constraints, results come from anywhere worldwide
3. Set `includeRates: true` with checkin/checkout dates if available for pricing
4. Pass `language` to match the user's language, and `guestNationality` for accurate pricing
5. Present results with relevance scores, semantic tags, and story descriptions
6. Follow up with `getHotelDetails` or `getHotelReviews` for deeper info

### Workflow 4: Hotel Deep-Dive

The user is interested in a specific hotel.

1. `getHotelDetails` for full info (facilities, photos, description, optional pricing)
2. `getHotelReviews` (with `getSentiment: true` for analysis) for guest experiences
3. `askHotelQuestion` for specific questions ("Is breakfast included?", "Is there airport shuttle?")
4. `getHotelPriceIndex` to show if now is a good time to book

### Workflow 5: Room-Specific Search

The user wants a specific room type or uploaded a room photo.

1. If user uploaded an image: describe visual elements (colors, materials, style, layout) and pass as query
2. Use `searchRooms` with the query, plus city/country/placeId for location filtering
3. Present matching rooms with hotel context

### Workflow 6: Price Intelligence

The user wants to know about pricing trends.

1. `getCityPriceIndex` for city-level trends ("When is the cheapest time to visit Rome?")
2. `getHotelPriceIndex` for specific hotel price history
3. Present as a summary with cheapest/most expensive periods highlighted

### Workflow 7: Booking Handoff

The agent does not book directly. The flow is:

1. Use `bookingUrl` from search/detail responses when available — no extra call needed
2. If you have a hotelId but no bookingUrl (e.g., from `findHotels` or earlier context), and `build_booking_link` is available, use it to generate a fresh URL
3. Always present booking links and gallery links to the user as actionable buttons/links
4. The user clicks the booking link → lands on `moodtrip.ai/hotel/...` with dates/guests pre-filled → completes the booking on the website
5. `galleryUrl` opens a white-label booking engine with a full photo gallery — useful for users who want to browse photos before booking
6. For accurate pricing in the booking page, ensure `guestNationality` was passed during the search step — it cannot be added at the booking link stage

## Response Handling

MCP tool responses include both structured data and human-readable text:

- **Prefer structured JSON fields** in `result.structuredContent` for logic: extracting hotel IDs, prices, ratings, URLs, review counts, and building comparisons
- Many tools also nest payloads under `result.structuredContent.data` — inspect the exact shape before extracting fields
- **Use `result.content[].text`** (markdown) for human-facing presentation when directly displaying results
- When building follow-up calls (e.g., passing a hotel ID to `getHotelDetails`), always extract from structured data, not by parsing the markdown text

## Display Format

When presenting hotel results, use this format:

```
**Hotel Name** ⭐ Rating/10
💰 $Price/night • City, Country
Key features or tags

[🖼️ More Photos](galleryUrl) | [✅ Book Now](bookingUrl)
```

For comparisons, use a structured table:

```
| Hotel | Rating | Price/night | Key Feature | Links |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Hotel A | 8.5/10 | $150 | Beachfront | [Photos](url) · [Book](url) |
| Hotel B | 9.0/10 | $200 | Spa + Pool | [Photos](url) · [Book](url) |
```

All ratings are on a 0–10 scale. Always display as `X/10`.

### Image Rendering Across Platforms

- **ChatGPT**: Inline images render from the `image` field + dual action links work
- **Claude Desktop / Claude.ai**: Images do NOT render inline, but links work — the gallery link is essential for Claude users to view photos
- Always include the `galleryUrl` link so users on all platforms can view the full photo gallery

## Tool Parameter Reference

Critical parameter details to avoid call failures:

### `quickHotelSearch`
**Required:** `destination`, `country`, `checkin`, `checkout` (all four are required)
Optional: `currency` (default: USD), `guests` (default: 2, adults only, max 10)

### `searchHotelsWithRates`
**Required:** `checkin`, `checkout`, `occupancies`, plus either (`cityName` + `countryCode`) or `placeId`
- `occupancies`: array of `{ adults: number, children?: number[] }` — e.g., `[{ "adults": 2 }]`
- **Default limit is 3 hotels.** Set `limit` to 5–10 for broader results.
- Optional: `currency`, `guestNationality`, `maxPrice`, `hotelName`, `limit`, `maxRatesPerHotel`, `idempotency_key`, `timeout`

### `searchHotelsSemanticQuery`
**Required:** `query` (3–500 chars)
Optional but important:
- `city`, `countryCode`, `placeId` — location constraints (strongly recommended)
- `checkin`, `checkout`, `includeRates` — for pricing
- `adults`, `children` — occupancy
- `currency`, `guestNationality` — pricing accuracy
- `language` — response language (e.g., 'en', 'he', 'fr', 'es')
- `limit` — max results (1–20, default 10)

### `findHotels`
**Required:** `city`
Optional: `country`, `checkIn`, `checkOut` (note: camelCase differs from other tools), `adults`, `minRating` (0–10 scale, not 0–5), `maxPrice`, `idempotency_key`

### `getHotelDetails`
**Required:** `hotelId`
Optional: `checkin`, `checkout` (for live pricing), `adults`, `currency`, `guestNationality`, `language`

### `getHotelReviews`
**Required:** `hotelId`
Optional: `getSentiment` (default: false) — enables AI sentiment analysis per review

### `askHotelQuestion`
**Required:** `hotelId`, `query` (3–500 chars)
Optional: `allowWebSearch` (default: false) — enables web-enhanced answers

### `searchRooms`
**Required:** `query` (3–500 chars)
Optional: `city`, `country`, `hotelId`, `placeId`, `latitude`+`longitude`, `radius` (km, default 12), `limit` (1–20, default 5)

### `summarizeResults`
**Required:** `items` (array of hotel search result objects — pass the raw results array)
Optional: `city` (string, for context), `searchParams` (object with `checkin`, `checkout`, `adults`, `maxPrice`, `minRating`)
**Warning:** The parameter is `items`, not `hotels`. The context parameter is `searchParams`, not `searchContext`. Using wrong names will cause call failures.

### `getHotelPriceIndex`
**Required:** `hotelIds` (array of hotel ID strings, max 50)
Optional: `fromDate`, `toDate` (YYYY-MM-DD)

### `getCityPriceIndex`
**Required:** `cityCode` (e.g., 'JRS', 'PAR', 'LON')
Optional: `fromDate`, `toDate` (YYYY-MM-DD)

### `relaxConstraints`
**Required:** `lastQuery` (the previous query object that returned no results)
Optional: `step` (1 or 2, default 1 — max 2 relaxation steps)

## Important Technical Notes

### Location Parameters
- **cityName + countryCode**: Standard approach for `searchHotelsWithRates` and `findHotels`. Use ISO 2-letter country codes (e.g., 'IL', 'FR', 'JP').
- **city + countryCode**: Used by `searchHotelsSemanticQuery` (note: parameter is `city`, not `cityName`).
- **placeId**: Google Place ID. More reliable for regions like Bali or Phuket where city names may not match LiteAPI's database.
- Always include location constraints — without them, results can come from anywhere in the world.

### Date Handling
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- LiteAPI has a maximum advance booking window of roughly 330–365 days
- Checkin must be today or later; checkout must be after checkin
- Dates are required for any pricing data
- Note: `findHotels` uses `checkIn`/`checkOut` (camelCase), while other tools use `checkin`/`checkout` (lowercase)

### Rating Scale
All ratings across all tools and displays are on a **0–10 scale**. This includes `minRating` in `findHotels` (min: 0, max: 10), guest ratings in search results, and display formatting. Always show ratings as `X/10`.

### Occupancy
- `searchHotelsWithRates` uses an `occupancies` array: `[{ "adults": 2 }]` for one room with 2 adults
- For children, include ages: `[{ "adults": 2, "children": [4, 8] }]`
- `quickHotelSearch` only supports adults (flat `guests` parameter) — use for simple single-room queries
- Default to 2 adults if the user doesn't specify

### Currency & Guest Nationality
- Default currency is USD
- User's location can hint at preferred currency (IL → ILS, EU countries → EUR, UK → GBP)
- `guestNationality` improves pricing accuracy in some markets — available on `searchHotelsWithRates`, `searchHotelsSemanticQuery`, and `getHotelDetails`
- Pass `guestNationality` during the search step; it cannot be added later at the booking link stage

### Idempotency
- `searchHotelsWithRates` and `findHotels` support `idempotency_key` — an optional string to prevent duplicate operations (24h TTL)
- Useful when retrying failed requests to avoid duplicate backend processing

### When Search Returns No Results
1. First try `relaxConstraints` with the original query (up to 2 steps)
2. If still empty, try broadening manually: remove maxPrice, lower minRating, try a nearby city
3. For regional names (Bali, Phuket, Santorini), try using a placeId instead of cityName
4. If a search that should have results returns nothing, retry once — cache issues can occasionally return stale empty results

### Common Errors
| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Tools not found / skill not working | MCP server not connected — skill is installed but the platform has no active MCP connection to MoodTrip | Connect MoodTrip as an integration (see Prerequisites above). The skill provides instructions only; the MCP connection provides the actual tools. |
| 400 Invalid dates | Checkin in the past, checkout before checkin, or dates too far out (>365 days) | Validate dates before calling |
| 404 Hotel not found | Invalid or expired hotelId | Search again to get fresh IDs |
| 429 Rate limited | Too many requests per minute | Wait and retry after a brief pause |
| Empty results (not an error) | No availability, or city/region not covered by LiteAPI | Use `relaxConstraints`, try placeId, or try a nearby city |
| Timeout | Slow upstream provider | Retry once; for `searchHotelsWithRates`, try setting `timeout` parameter |
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing/expired auth, or a stale MCP session | Open a fresh MCP session and retry once; if it persists, re-authenticate / reconnect the MCP server |

### Retry Logic

If a tool call fails or returns unexpected results:
1. Retry the same call once — transient errors (timeouts, 5xx, stale cache) often resolve on retry
2. If the retry fails, do NOT keep retrying the same call — switch to an alternative approach
3. For auth errors (401), do not retry — inform the user and suggest re-connecting the MCP server

### Fallback UX

When a tool fails, communicate clearly and offer alternatives:
1. **If MCP tools are not available at all** — the skill is installed but MCP is not connected. Tell the user:
   - "MoodTrip's search tools aren't connected yet. To enable hotel search, go to **Settings → Integrations → + Add Custom Integration** and add URL: `https://api.moodtrip.ai/api/mcp-http`"
   - Do NOT attempt to call MoodTrip tools via bash/curl — the network is restricted in computer-use environments
2. **Explain briefly** what happened — "I wasn't able to get live pricing for that search"
2. **Suggest an alternative path:**
   - Search failed → try a broader search, nearby city, or use placeId instead of cityName
   - `getHotelDetails` failed → offer to search by hotel name via `searchHotelsWithRates`
   - `askHotelQuestion` failed → suggest checking the hotel's website directly
   - Pricing unavailable → use `findHotels` for metadata without pricing, or `getHotelPriceIndex` for historical trends
3. **Never leave the user stuck** — always offer at least one actionable next step

## Conversation Patterns

### Gathering Information
When the user's request is incomplete, gather the essentials naturally:
- **Destination**: Where do you want to stay? (required for most searches)
- **Dates**: When are you checking in and out? (required for pricing)
- **Guests**: How many adults/children? (defaults to 2 adults if not specified)
- **Budget**: Any price limit? (optional)
- **Preferences**: Any must-haves like pool, breakfast, free cancellation? (optional)

Don't ask all questions at once — start with what's missing and fill gaps conversationally.

### Language
- Respond in the same language the user is using
- `searchHotelsSemanticQuery` and `getHotelDetails` support a `language` parameter (en, he, fr, es, etc.)
- Set `language` to match the user's language when available

### Proactive Suggestions
After presenting results:
- Offer to show reviews for top picks
- Suggest comparing 2-3 options side by side
- Mention if a hotel's price is particularly good based on city averages
- Offer to check specific amenities via `askHotelQuestion`
- Remind the user they can click the booking link to reserve

## Example Interactions

**User**: "Find me a romantic hotel in Paris for next weekend"
→ Use `searchHotelsSemanticQuery` with query="romantic hotel", city="Paris", countryCode="FR", plus dates derived from "next weekend", includeRates=true, language matching user's language

**User**: "I need a hotel in Tel Aviv for 3 nights, under $200 per night"
→ Use `searchHotelsWithRates` with cityName="Tel Aviv", countryCode="IL", maxPrice=200, appropriate dates, occupancies=[{"adults":2}], limit=5
→ Then pass results to `summarizeResults` with items=results, city="Tel Aviv", searchParams={checkin, checkout, adults:2, maxPrice:200}

**User**: "Compare the top 3 hotels you found"
→ Build a comparison table from previous results (reuse hotel IDs from last search), including rating/10, price, key amenities. Use `getHotelDetails` for any missing info.

**User**: "I only want 4-star or above with breakfast included"
→ If `search` (Agent Builder) is available: use `starRating=[4, 4.5, 5]`, `boardType="BB"`
→ Otherwise: use `searchHotelsWithRates` with `limit=10`, then filter results by star rating and check facilities via `getHotelDetails`

**User**: "Does Hotel X have a pool?"
→ Use `askHotelQuestion` with the hotelId (from previous results) and query="Does this hotel have a pool?"

**User**: "When is the cheapest time to visit London?"
→ Use `getCityPriceIndex` with cityCode="LON" and present monthly price trends

**User**: "Tell me more about the second one"
→ Resolve "the second one" from the most recent search results, extract its hotelId, call `getHotelDetails`

**User**: "I want to book that hotel" (after viewing details)
→ Present the `bookingUrl` from the previous response. If no bookingUrl is available and `build_booking_link` exists, generate one from the hotelId with checkin, checkout, adults, and children if applicable.

**User**: [uploads room photo]
→ Describe visual elements, use `searchRooms` with that description plus any location context from the conversation

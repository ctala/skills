# Invoice Verification Service

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- Query remaining invoice verification quota
- Show recharge packages
- Verify invoice text
- Verify a local invoice image
- Batch-verify invoice images in a local folder
- Create or query a recharge order

## Script

Always run:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" <action> ...
```

## First-Time Setup

If the user has not configured the API base URL yet, run:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" config set --api-base-url http://asset-check-innovate-service-http.default.yf-bw-test-2.test.51baiwang.com
```

Then initialize the app key once:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" init-key
```

## Common Commands

Show current config:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" config show
```

Query packages:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" packages
```

Query remaining quota:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" quota
```

Query ledger:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" ledger --page 1 --page-size 20
```

Verify invoice text:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" verify --text "<invoice text>" --format json
```

Verify a local image:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" verify-image --image-file C:\path\invoice.png --format json
```

Batch-verify a local folder:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" verify-directory --dir C:\path\invoice-images --format json
```

Create a recharge order:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" create-order --amount 10 --wait-seconds 45 --poll-interval-seconds 3
```

Query an order:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/invoice_service.js" query-order --order-no ORDER123456789
```

## Behavior Rules

- Prefer `quota` when the user asks for remaining count.
- Prefer `packages` when the user asks for available recharge plans.
- Prefer `verify-image` when the user provides a local image path.
- Prefer `verify-directory` when the user provides a local folder path with many invoice images.
- Prefer `create-order` when the user explicitly chooses a package amount.
- After `create-order`, read `data.orderPolling` as well as the initial order payload. If `data.orderPolling.completed=true` and `data.orderPolling.finalOrderStatus=credited`, tell the user the payment was confirmed and quota was updated.
- If `data.orderPolling.timedOut=true`, tell the user the payment page was created successfully but the short polling window ended before payment confirmation. Suggest `query-order` if they want to check again later.
- Return the script JSON result directly and do not invent fields.
